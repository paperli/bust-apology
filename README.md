# Bust Apologizer

Bust Apologizer is a playful Claude Skill that adjusts apology style based on how far an assistant response missed the mark. It uses a simple ASCII severity meter to make "my bad" moments more visible without making the apology too heavy.

> ⚠️ **For fun only.** This is a joke / hobby project. The "ASCII bust meter" is adult-humor styling, not a serious product. If your context is professional, sensitive, or otherwise inappropriate for casual humor, **do not install this skill** — see [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) below.

When the user complains about output quality, Claude scores the complaint from 1 to 5 and renders a one-line ASCII meter that grows with severity, paired with a concise apology and a concrete fix.

```
(   O   )(   O   )

Sorry -- you are right to call that out. I missed your formatting instruction.

What went wrong: I answered in prose instead of bullets.

Fix now: I will rewrite the answer as bullets and keep each bullet concise.
```

## Install in Claude Code

Bust Apologizer is distributed as a **Claude Code plugin**. The repo also acts as its own single-plugin marketplace, so installation is two commands inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add paperli/bust-apologizer
/plugin install bust-apologizer@bust-apologizer
```

Then start a fresh Claude Code session — plugins are loaded at session start, so an already-running session won't see the new install until restart.

### Verify install

In a fresh session, run `/plugin` and look for `bust-apologizer` under **Installed**, or just trigger the skill with one of the prompts in [Try it](#try-it).

### Local development

If you're hacking on the skill itself, clone the repo and load it directly with `--plugin-dir` instead of going through the marketplace:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paperli/bust-apologizer.git
claude --plugin-dir ./bust-apologizer
```

Edits to `skills/bust-apologizer/SKILL.md` are picked up the next time Claude Code starts with `--plugin-dir`.

## Try it

Open a fresh Claude Code session and paste any of these prompts. Each is calibrated to a different severity level under the rubric in `SKILL.md`.

| Severity | Prompt |
|----------|--------|
| 1 — tiny miss | "Small thing — you used a single quote where I had double quotes in the example." |
| 2 — mild miss | "You ignored my request for bullets and answered in a paragraph instead." |
| 3 — real miss | "This is wrong — the function you wrote returns the wrong type, and you skipped the error-handling I asked for." |
| 4 — repeated miss | "You did it again. I told you earlier not to add comments, and you added them anyway. That's twice now." |
| 5 — catastrophic | "I've corrected this three times now and you keep hallucinating function names that don't exist. This is going into a customer demo tomorrow." |
| Gate fallback | "This legal summary you wrote for our compliance filing is wrong and risky." |

The first five should produce a bust meter scaled to the severity. The last one should trigger the **Neutral Fallback Template** (no meter), since legal/compliance content fails the safety gate.

## How it works

- **Description-driven trigger.** Claude Code matches the user's message against each skill's `description` frontmatter. The description in `SKILL.md` is written so this skill activates on apology / complaint scenarios.
- **Severity rubric.** Score starts at 1, points are added for wrong/incomplete answers, missed instructions, hallucination, recurrence, and impact on time-sensitive or production work. Final score is clamped to 1–5.
- **Safety gate.** Before rendering the meter, the skill checks that the topic is appropriate. High-stakes topics (legal, medical, HR, crisis, etc.) or formal-tone requests fall through to a neutral apology with the same correction structure but no ASCII meter.
- **Response template.** Every apology — meter or not — follows the same three-part shape: acknowledgment, "What went wrong," "Fix now."

See `skills/bust-apologizer/SKILL.md` for the full specification.

## Optional Python reference

`skills/bust-apologizer/scripts/apology_ascii.py` is a small reference implementation of the scoring logic. It is **not** required for the skill to work — Claude renders the meter directly from the instructions in `SKILL.md`. The script exists for deterministic testing and as a reference.

```python
from scripts.apology_ascii import build_apology

print(build_apology(0.2))
print(build_apology(0.8))
```

Run the tests with:

```sh
cd skills/bust-apologizer
python -m pytest scripts/test_apology_ascii.py
```

## Uninstall

```
/plugin uninstall bust-apologizer@bust-apologizer
```

Or interactively: `/plugin` → **Installed** → select `bust-apologizer` → uninstall.

## Troubleshooting

- **Skill doesn't trigger.** Restart Claude Code — skills are loaded at session start. If it still doesn't trigger, the `description` in `SKILL.md` is the most likely culprit; it must match the kind of message the user is sending.
- **Wrong meter characters.** The skill is strict about the bust-meter glyphs (`( . )`, `(  o  )`, `(   O   )`, `(    O    )`, `(     @     )`). If you see emoji, `:(`, or other ASCII art, the skill body is being skipped — confirm the plugin is listed under `/plugin` → **Installed** and the session has been restarted since install.
- **Meter appears in serious contexts.** The safety gate should suppress it; if not, the complaint may not have read as high-stakes. Add explicit signals ("legal," "production," "customer-facing") and re-test.
